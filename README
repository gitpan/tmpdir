tmpdir - Module to automathize the configuration of the temporary directory in
every OS supported by PERL

What's the problem?
Every PERL tool use temporary files.
If you want your code can be simply portable on different OS, you need to select
the correct tempory directory (the other solution is to use ./ directory).
The purpose of this module is to automathize the configuration of the temporary
directory in every OS supported by PERL.
We need your help.
We ask you to send us the correct tempory directory for every OS supported by
PERL and to suggest us good modifies (<sanface@sanface.com>).

At the moment this is the list of OS supported:
Windows 32 bit ('95, '98, NT) c:/temp/ (or c:/windows/temp/)
AIX Solaris IRIX Linux        /tmp/
Mac                           /desktop folder/temp/
OpenVMS                       /sys\$scratch/ (or SYS\$SCRATCH)

If the module can't recognize your OS the temporary directory is set to ./

Use testtmpdir.pl to test the module on your OS and testOS.pl to know the value
of $^O PERL variable on your OS.
